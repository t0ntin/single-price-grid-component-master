## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I practiced using flexbox. I was hoping to make it responsive without using media queries. The bottom right container wasn't wrapping at first. It was because I needed to use max-width instead of width for the main container.
I also learned that if  border-radius is not working, I can use overflow:hidden; to fix it.


```css
  border-radius: 7px;
  overflow: hidden;
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - This helped me when my flex items were not wrapping and when the borde radius wasn't working.
